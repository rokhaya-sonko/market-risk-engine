# Market Risk Lab

This repository is **strictly focused on Market Risk**.

It illustrates how market risk is measured, explained and monitored on a portfolio:
- market data analysis (returns, volatility, correlation regimes)
- yield curve construction
- pricing used as a risk input (bonds, swaps, vanilla options)
- sensitivities (DV01, Delta, Gamma, Vega)
- hedging as risk neutralisation
- Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
- stress testing
- PnL explain and risk attribution


The goal is to reproduce **real Market Risk workflows**, using simple and transparent Python implementations.
